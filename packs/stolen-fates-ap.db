Harpies can eat most creatures but strongly prefer sapient prey-humans and elves are their favorite. Although harpies will eat goblins if sufficiently hungry, they dislike their flavor and avoid eating them if possible. This doesn't comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of harpies.

If the trophy is from a monster whose level is lower than the PC's level, the mountain man mocks the PC for being \"proud of defeating a weakling\" and offers no reward. Once a reward is given, the mountain man warns the PC, \"Now don't you be going off to sell that thing for gold, and don't even think of coming back for more rewards until you've used these all up!\" The mountain man has an eerie ability to know if a PC hasn't used a current reward, or if they sold it for a profit—PCs who fit either category cannot receive new rewards from the mountain man on subsequent visits.</p>","value":"<p><strong>Suit</strong> Shield (Con)</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong> chaotic neutral</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>The Mountain Man</em> represents creatures with incredible physical power.

Harpies can eat most creatures but strongly prefer sapient prey-humans and elves are their favorite. Although harpies will eat goblins if sufficiently hungry, they dislike their flavor and avoid eating them if possible. This doesn't comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of harpies.

It uses the critical specialization of the bow weapon group, rather than the firearm critical specialization.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">3</span> Interact (evocation, magical)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The <em>spike launcher</em> is loaded</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>spike launcher</em> fires a volley of smaller spikes in a @Template[type:burst|distance:10] centered anywhere within its range.

Ophidian eyes lend nagaji an imperious visage, with irises that span every color of the rainbow.</p>\n<p>Nagaji physiology varies somewhat. Some possess vestigial tails, while others have sharp claws, and some even sport impressive fangs that can inject a simple venom. Like snakes, nagaji are cold-blooded and reproduce by laying eggs; as a result, nagaji territories rarely overlap with those of mammalian humanoids, since their environmental needs diverge so widely. They're a hardy and strong people, but their close ties to nagas mean many have the potential for powerful magic, as well.</p>\n<p>Long ago, the naga goddess Nalinivati created the first nagaji as the backbone of a society that respected nagas. But the nagaji were never mindless vassals, and the goddess gifted them with free will. Many nagaji willingly serve nagas to this day, honoring some as outright divinities. While outsiders might regard nagaji initially as brainwashed servants, nagaji dispute this claim. Of course there are evil and unfair naga overlords, but there are just as many fair and just naga rulers, and nagaji history remembers various rebellions and revolutions when a matriarch overstepped her bounds to support a new naga's claims of rulership. Nagaji accurately note that their long history with nagas is no simple matter and claim that the partnership goes both ways: nagas rely as much on nagaji for the running of their empires as nagaji rely on nagas to lead their people to prosperity.</p>\n<p>Although nagaji might be encountered in diverse cities and urban centers, their communities are concentrated in environments that suit their biology, namely jungles and tropical forests. Where many species would languish in the heat and humidity, nagaji bask in the warmth and thrive.</p>","privateNotes":"","alliance":"party"},"traits":{"value":["humanoid","nagaji"],"senses":{"value":"low-light vision"},"languages":{"value":["common","draconic","tien"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"rarity":"rare","size":{"value":"med"},"attitude":{"value":"hostile"}},"resources":{},"schema":{"version":0.84,"lastMigration":null},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":1},"dex":{"mod":2},"con":{"mod":3},"int":{"mod":1},"wis":{"mod":4},"cha":{"mod":2}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":14,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":13,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":17,"saveDetail":""}}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.stolen-fate-bestiary.tVZ7ijV3W1HmMwzz"},"pf2e":{}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"bNdr0dH4sIElBXOJ":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.12.9","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1687698151860,"modifiedTime":1687698177621,"lastModifiedBy":"bNdr0dH4sIElBXOJ"},"folder":"h888hevH6rZrjmyG","sort":150000,"_id":"Zi559Iq6tgZgmSvs"},{"prototypeToken":{"displayName":20,"flags":{"wall-height":{"tokenHeight":0},"barbrawl":{"resourceBars":{"bar1":{"order":0,"id":"bar1","attribute":"attributes.hp","mincolor":"#FF0000","maxcolor":"#80FF00","position":"bottom-inner","otherVisibility":0,"ownerVisibility":30,"gmVisibility":-1,"hideFull":true,"hideEmpty":false,"hideCombat":false,"hideNoCombat":false,"indentLeft":null,"indentRight":null,"shareHeight":false,"style":"user","label":"","invert":false,"invertDirection":false,"subdivisions":null,"subdivisionsOwner":false,"fgImage":"","bgImage":"","opacity":null}}},"pf2e":{"autoscale":false,"linkToActorSize":true}},"name":"Vrock","actorLink":false,"texture":{"src":"modules/qwert-kingmaker/assets/tokens/fiendish/demon/vrock.webp","scaleX":1.5,"scaleY":1.5,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"color":null,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"type":null,"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"sight":{"enabled":false,"range":null,"angle":360,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"brightness":0,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[],"randomImg":false},"img":"modules/qwert-kingmaker/assets/portraits/fiendish/demon/vrock.webp","items":[{"_id":"eqiwUtaFLOTC1oND","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Divine Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":""},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.84,"lastMigration":null},"ability":{"value":"cha"},"spelldc":{"value":18,"dc":26,"mod":0},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"prepared":{"value":"innate","flexible":false},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":true},"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"proficiency":{"value":0},"displayLevels":{},"slots":{"slot0":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot1":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot2":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot3":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot4":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot5":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot6":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot7":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot8":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot9":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot10":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot11":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0}},"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","effects":[],"folder":null,"ownership":{"default":0},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"ArbkmxGrqRbaOPC3","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.VlNcjmYyu95vOUe8"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/dimension-door.webp","name":"Dimension Door","sort":200000,"system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>Opening a door that bypasses normal space, you instantly transport yourself and any items you're wearing and holding from your current space to a clear space within range you can see.

seeing new lands and meeting unusual creatures. Cloud dragons range in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they're at home. Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.</p>\n<p>A cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant for living in the moment is not a personality flaw-they're more than capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won't make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow's problems as they are today's.</p>\n<p>Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items-they are driven to gather a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively.

Erikanesh then steers conversation to some of their wares and goes so far as to press one of them upon the PCs, believing they’ll carry—and thus, effectively advertise—the antiquarian’s historical relics. The party receives either an amaranthine pavise (Grand Bazaar 30), a greater staff of final rest (Grand Bazaar 30), or a cape of the mountebank embroidered with vibrant patterns for free, as they prefer. If the PCs can’t agree on a choice, Erikanesh defers to whichever PC succeeded at the Influence check that brought the group’s total to this threshold. The PCs gain 60 XP.</p></section><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-epNNhzumnzm8K2Uz\"><p><strong>Influence 4</strong> The antiquarian gossips about some of the other proprietors in the Grand Bazaar, including those Dieral seems to know best: Arhan Benimaya at Kraken’s Ink Tattoo and Clemeth Falk at Reclaimed Paradise. Erikanesh considers both individuals to be utterly lacking in academic discipline or good business sense. This gossip gives the PCs a +1 circumstance bonus to attempts to Discover for both of these individuals.</p></section><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-m96eDBV7nLSgJvjQ\"><p><strong>Influence 6</strong> Realizing that the PCs are people with insight and wealth, Erikanesh invites them to shop at any time. The PCs gain access to all uncommon wares sold by Historia Reliquary (Grand Bazaar 30–31). Erikanesh admits that dealing with Dieral can be somewhat wearying, as his mobile shop is filled with a lot of useless clutter, but the occasional rare finds make entertaining Dieral worthwhile. In fact, Erikanesh recently heard that Dieral had come into possession of a particularly rare harrow card. The PCs gain 60 XP.</p></section><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-se5T8319cmeQr6VG\"><p><strong>Influence 8</strong> Erikanesh feels they can trust the PCs with information they know about where to find Dieral. Unfortunately, it isn’t much; Erikanesh only knows that the Dieral said he’s been living somewhere in the Eastgate district of the city. The PCs gain 80 XP.</p></section><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-yaByjQAE5LP0SKHW\"><p><strong>Resistances</strong> Erikanesh considers the harrow and those who believe in its mystical reputation to be a bit silly.

He hasn’t seen Dieral in a few weeks, which he suddenly realizes is an unusually long time. In addition, Arhan is now willing to take the PCs as customers and offers to sell magical tattoos to them. The PCs gain access to the tattoos sold by Kraken’s Ink Tattoos (Grand Bazaar 38), and to the familiar tattoo and warding tattoos from Pathfinder Secrets of Magic (pages 164 and 165). The PCs gain 30 XP.</p></section><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-epNNhzumnzm8K2Uz\"><p><strong>Influence 4</strong> Arhan believes the PCs to be good people, worthy of the magical protection his tattoos provide. He agrees to scribe a greater enveloping light tattoo (Grand Bazaar 38) upon anyone who wants one free of charge (up to one per PC). If the PCs have told Arhan about their encounters with devils, he offers to instead scribe a fiend warding tattoo (Secrets of Magic 165) on anyone who prefers that tattoo. Arhan thinks about some other contacts in the Grand Bazaar who Dieral has mentioned in the past: Erikanesh at Historia Reliquary and Clemeth Falk at Reclaimed Paradise. He gives some suggestions about how to best talk with these people. These suggestions gives the PCs a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation checks used as Influence actions for both of these individuals. The PCs gain 60 XP.</p></section><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-m96eDBV7nLSgJvjQ\"><p><strong>Influence 6</strong> Arhan shares some of his secret processes, providing the PCs with access to the Tattoo Artist skill feat (Secrets of Magic 164) and Arcane Tattoo, Ornate Tattoo, and Virtue‑Forged Tattoo human ancestry feats (Pathfinder Lost Omens Character Guide 11, 13, and 14). Arhan can help one PC retrain into one of these feats each day, although this takes an entire day. At this point, Arhan considers the PCs to be worth enticing as repeat customers. He offers them a permanent 10% discount on all uncommon wares sold by Kraken’s Ink Tattoos. The PCs gain 30 XP.</p></section><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-se5T8319cmeQr6VG\"><p><strong>Influence 8</strong> Arhan offers a clue that might help the PCs find Dieral. When looking over a book of tattoo images, Dieral remarked that one of the images reminded him of the sign above a safe place he knows. It’s where he’d go if he were ever in trouble. It takes Arhan a few minutes to find that image, but he shows it to the PCs: that of a stylized horse in profile. Arhan apologies that it’s not much, but he hopes that the clue is helpful. The PCs gain 80 XP.</p></section><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-nnpphMyNpPBXiPWm\"><p><strong>Resistances</strong> Arhan relies upon the support of his friends and allies. If a character tries to influence Arhan while he’s alone (that is, while Apple, Brine, or Nara aren’t around, as is often the case during off‑hours or after dark), increase the DC to Influence by 2.</p></section><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-jVMFUlclreD8BL7P\"><p><strong>Weaknesses</strong> Arhan can best focus while he works.

She hasn’t seen him in a while but notes that Dieral talked a lot about other friends in the Grand Bazaar, including Erikanesh at Historia Reliquary and Arhan Benimaya at Kraken’s Ink Tattoo. Clemeth recounts what she’s heard about these people, stating that it seems easy to lie to Erikanesh (“that stuffy lizard sure likes a story, even if it isn’t true—maybe especially if it isn’t true.”) and that Arhan appreciates good workmanship (“We agree on the value of working with tools, but there’s something fishy about him other than the smell of his shop.”) These are clues to some of the easiest Influence skills to use against these people (Deception and Crafting, respectively). The PCs gain 30 XP.</p></section><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-pon6xpN3hFDllpZs\"><p><strong>Influence 4</strong> Clemeth offers a chance for the PCs to try out her latest obstacle course in the scrapyard—a gauntlet of pivoting blades, greasy ladders, and unstable platforms. A PC can try to navigate the obstacle course instead of making an Influence skill check in subsequent Influence rounds. Doing so requires successfully Running the Obstacle Course (page 17). The first time a PC succeeds, Clemeth nods in respect then opens up further about Dieral, expressing some worry about how he obsessed over his collection more than she considered healthy. He told her more than once that if he ever found a really rare, magical card, he’d consider giving up his card‑peddling business. He thought for a minute, though, and admitted that if he did get a very powerful magic card, dangerous people might be after it, too. Clemeth laughed off Dieral’s worry, poked his bony shoulder, and told him that was a good reason to get into better shape. She’s now worried that her friend is in real danger and hopes the PCs can help him. The PCs gain 60 XP. If at least one PC completes the obstacle course, increase this reward to 90 XP.</p></section><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-cTl4z1lpStwEd2I7\"><p><strong>Influence 6</strong> Clemeth provides access to all the wares in Reclaimed Paradise (Grand Bazaar 76–77) at a permanent 10% discount, although the PCs aren’t likely to have much use for vehicles in this Adventure Path.</p></section><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-toWjH1gFZyyP2NUL\"><p><strong>Influence 8</strong> Clemeth remembers that Dieral seemed familiar with some of the specialty repair tools he saw her using. She expressed surprise—as he didn’t seem like someone good with his hands—and Dieral made a dismissive comment about an abandoned forge that he’d go to if he ever got into trouble. Clemeth hopes that clue will help the PCs find him. The PCs gain 80 XP.</p></section><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-v2yylGqsDIXfyeNB\"><p><strong>Resistances</strong> Dishonesty is one of the few things that shake Clemeth’s calm.

Harpies can eat most creatures but strongly prefer sapient prey-humans and elves are their favorite. Although harpies will eat goblins if sufficiently hungry, they dislike their flavor and avoid eating them if possible. This doesn't comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of harpies.

If the trophy is from a monster whose level is lower than the PC's level, the mountain man mocks the PC for being \"proud of defeating a weakling\" and offers no reward. Once a reward is given, the mountain man warns the PC, \"Now don't you be going off to sell that thing for gold, and don't even think of coming back for more rewards until you've used these all up!\" The mountain man has an eerie ability to know if a PC hasn't used a current reward, or if they sold it for a profit—PCs who fit either category cannot receive new rewards from the mountain man on subsequent visits.</p>","value":"<p><strong>Suit</strong> Shield (Con)</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong> chaotic neutral</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>The Mountain Man</em> represents creatures with incredible physical power.

Harpies can eat most creatures but strongly prefer sapient prey-humans and elves are their favorite. Although harpies will eat goblins if sufficiently hungry, they dislike their flavor and avoid eating them if possible. This doesn't comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of harpies.
